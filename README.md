# gttables_repo

This repository is designed to document the tutorials and scripting with Rich Iannone's *gt* package to create tables in *R*.  I frequently publish tables in my work and I find the *gt* package nothing short of amazing to prepare publication quality tables.  The *gt* package is simply too complicated to remember all of the details.  This, and my other repositories help me remember how to use the elements of complicated packages.  

1. The first tutorial was presented in Tom Mock's blog, *The Mockup; 10+ Guidelines for Better Tables in R*.  Supporting the details of Tom Mock's blog, David Keyes and Tom Mock discuss Tom's blog on better tables guidelines in YouTube tutorial on *R for the rest of Us* YouTube channel.  The YouTube tutorial and presentation on the {*gt*} package was presented on December 13, 2022 entitled [*Making high-quality tables in R with the gt package: a conversation with Tom Mock*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dxDeotwylr8).  Tom's blog post is predicated on an article on table guidelines by J.A. Schwabish (2022).^[Schwabish, J. A. (2020). *Ten Guidelines for Better Tables*. Journal of Benefit-Cost Analysis, 11(2), 151â€“178. https://doi.org/10.1017/bca.2020.11] 

2. The second tutorial on the {*gt*} package was presented by Rich Iannone on March 30, 2022, on YouTube channel *Posit PBC* entitled [Rich Iannone || {gt} Intendo Game Data Project Walkthrough || RStudio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPRVzk9pvno)

4. Tutorial Four highlights the new functions in {*gt*} version 0.7.0, YouTube channel *Posit PBC* entitled [What's New in {gt} 0.7.0?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbcAX3ayyzk)
